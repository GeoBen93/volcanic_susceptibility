    "Based on the method developed by Weller et al. 2006 (Modelling the spatial distribution of volcanoes: an example form Armenia. In: IAVCEI Spec. Pub. 1, Statistics in volcanology)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculates probability of vent opening at user specified points during an eruption assuming a decaying probability away from previously active vents.\n",
    "2. Rate of probability decay is assumed to be Gaussian. The bandwidth of this Guassian kernel is estimated using the user defined vent location data. Nearest neighbour distances of vents are calucated and their cumulative density distribution of distance is compared to expected Gaussian distributions. The bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel is optimised to produce the best fit between the expected gaussian distribution and the user defined data.\n",
    "3. Probability at each particular location is calculated as the sum of probabilities associated with proximity to every vent, with a fixed bandwidth defined by step 2."
